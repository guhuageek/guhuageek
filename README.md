## hello im shayna (she/her) and im a cs student at [illinois](https://github.com/illinois) and sde intern at [aws](https://github.com/awslabs) :)

**logic problem**: a puzzle in which the answer can be deduced from a given set of premises.

ive always liked documenting and solving logic problems! some of my interests include cybersecurity, open source, and chess.


### im currently working on:
- **aws crypto tools (core libraries)** integrating code coverage metrics for the [aws encryption sdk](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/encryption-sdk/latest/developer-guide/introduction.html).
- **[built by girls at uiuc](https://www.facebook.com/BuiltByGirlsUIUC)** as founder and president of a chapter of the [national organization](https://www.builtbygirls.com/) dedicated to preparing female leaders for careers in technology.
- **[streaming](https://www.twitch.tv/robloxbabe2000)** chess and sharing my love and knowledge of the game with the community. fun fact: im rank 100 in the country for girls under 21!
- **[documenting](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GsTGTIvQ_MATyW99rFxuyeN373b769Ka?usp=sharing)** the things i do to help both me and (hopefully) whoever else happens across this corner of the internet! especially when it involves [shibas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6qoHU2EmZ18)!

### im currently learning:
- **[dafny](https://github.com/dafny-lang/dafny)** and about the world of formal verification.
- **cryptography** as both a 2019 amazon future engineer and 2020 sde intern for aws cryptography.
- **open source software** and how to [contribute](https://github.com/aws/aws-encryption-sdk-java/pull/119).
- **[data structures and algorithms](https://courses.engr.illinois.edu/cs225/fa2019/policy/syllabus/), system programming, distributed systems, and more** through my school's coursework.

### logic problems i think about:
- protecting internet-connected systems, including software, hardware, and data.
- proving whether a system is correct and complete.
- the scansion of latin poetry. fun fact: horace's [ode 4.7](https://www.johnderbyshire.com/Readings/odes-4-7.html) is my favorite!
- understanding and [applying](https://lichess.org/@/shayna_begonia) chess theory.
